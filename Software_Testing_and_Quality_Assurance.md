# Quality Review for "Swift Pay"

---

## Overview

This capstone requires learners to apply skills from across the module to a realistic feature review.

### Scenario

A fictional Ghanaian fintech startup, **Swift Pay**, is adding a **"Scan to Pay" QR code** feature to its mobile app.

### Artifacts

A one-page feature specification with:

- Acceptance criteria
- UI mockup of the feature

The artifacts intentionally contain ambiguities and potential issues.

---

## Task Requirements

Learners must complete a structured **QA Review Template** containing the following:

### 1. Positive Test Case

Write one **happy path** test case to verify the core functionality.

**Example:**

- Successful QR scan and payment completion

### 2. Negative / Edge Case Test Case

Write one test case for an unexpected scenario.

**Examples:**

- Scanning an invalid QR code
- Network failure during transaction
- Incorrect transaction PIN

### 3. Bug Report

Identify a potential bug from:

- An ambiguity in the specification, **OR**
- A flaw in the UI mockup

Write a complete bug report for the issue.

### 4. Process Improvement Suggestion

From your specialization's viewpoint, suggest one action the **Swift Pay** team could have taken earlier to prevent the issue.

This reinforces the **Shift Left Testing** mindset.

This feature allows a registered Swift Pay user to initiate a payment to a merchant by scanning a QR code using their smartphone camera from within the Swift Pay app.

2. User enters payment amount (if amount is not embedded)
3. User confirms transaction
4. User enters PIN

---

## 4. Out of Scope

The following are **NOT** included in this feature:

- **Generating QR codes for merchants** — handled by the Merchant App team
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) QR payments** — this feature supports only Peer-to-Merchant (P2M)

---

## 5. Acceptance Criteria (AC)

| ID | User Action | System Response |
|----|-------------|----------------|
| AC-01 | User taps the "Scan" icon from the app home screen | The app opens the phone camera in scan mode |
| AC-02 | User points camera at a valid merchant QR code | System decodes QR code and navigates to Payment Confirmation screen |
| AC-03 | On the Payment Confirmation screen | Merchant name (e.g., "Kofi's Cafe") is displayed at the top |
| AC-04 | User enters amount to pay | User can input amount and "Confirm Payment" button becomes active |
| AC-05 | User taps "Confirm Payment" | User is prompted to enter 4-digit transaction PIN |
| AC-06 | User enters correct PIN | Transaction is processed quickly |
| AC-07 | Upon successful transaction | Success message appears showing amount and merchant name |
